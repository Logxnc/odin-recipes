    <h2>Italian Pizza Recipe</h2>
    <p>You may be surprised to find that small discs of thinly sliced pepperoni aren't on the menu at an authentic Italian pizzeria. Instead, a generous portion of prosciutto, large chunks of mozzarella, a variety of hand-picked herbs and greens such as rosemary, basil, arugula, and capers.</p>
